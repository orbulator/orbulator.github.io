## PID Ball Balancing Robot - June 2025

This project was created as the final project for ECE 433- Embedded Systems at Boise State University. 
It consists of 3d printed mechanical parts and electromechanical components, controlled by an STM32 microcontroller
programmed at the register level.

A detailed design report can be found here:

## Tiny Giant Amp Redesign - August 2025
### Project Goals
I wanted to build this DIY amplifier build, but the amplifier chip used in the design is no longer manufacturered. My goals for this project are to 
1. Redesign and test the schematic using a different amplifier chip
2. Design the new printed circuit board
3. Build a working prototype and test
4. Create detailed documentation so others can build this project as well.
