## PID Ball Balancing Robot - June 2025

This project was created as the final project for ECE 433 - Embedded Systems at Boise State University. 

It consists of 3d printed mechanical parts, electromechanical components, and software control algorithms. The hardware is controlled by an STM32 microcontroller programmed at the register level.

A detailed design report can be found here:

## Tiny Giant Amp Redesign - August 2025
### Project Goals
I wanted to build [this](https://sportellimike.github.io/portfolio/assets/Tiny-Giant-Build-PDF-rev2.pdf) DIY amplifier build, but the TDA7240 amplifier chip used in the design is no longer manufacturered. My goals for this project are to:

1. Redesign the circuit using the TI LM1875T amplifier chip
2. Build a working prototype and test
3. Design a new printed circuit board
4. Create detailed documentation so others can build this project as well.
